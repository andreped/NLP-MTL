NLP workshop 01.02.2020, Cognito, Strise

*** STRISE ***

- Superpowers across the enterprise
- Customization -> Personalization
- Structuring unstructuring data that was previously structured (before uploaded to the "internet")
- Cluster smart content from Apple -> extract smart information first
- AI + knowledge graphs = <3
- Spit out semantic representation (or meaning) of sentences
   -> ex. apple/samsung, or iphone/samsung -> just two companies
      also could be other languages
- What are Strise using:
    - Spark for big-data distributed processing
    - TensorFlow, keras, PyTorch
    - MLFlow <- organize ML stuff
    - Main backend Scala <- cross compatible with Java (dont need to write Java)
    - Everything runs on Kubernetes/Docker
    - Graphical AI


NLP:
- Main challenge, natural language is ambigeous and complex -> need to kind of guess a lot
- split sentence in sentences -> split on periods ex.
- Classify text if positive or negative -> IMDB dataset
